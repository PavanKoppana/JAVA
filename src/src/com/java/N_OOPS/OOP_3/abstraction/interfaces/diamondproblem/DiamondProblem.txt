Diamond problem: if you have two child interfaces of Parent interface
which shares the same default method, and you create a class by
implementing two child interfaces, the compiler doesn't know which
method to implement, this situation is called Diamond problem.

Resolution: you can resolve this by overriding the same method in
your class, you can also choose which interface method to override.
Check the code for more details.
