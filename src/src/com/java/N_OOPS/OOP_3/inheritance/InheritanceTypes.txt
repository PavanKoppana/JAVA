Types:
1) Single inheritance
2) Multi level inheritance
3) Multiple inheritance
4) Hybrid inheritance
5) Hierarchical inheritance
Note: You can prevent the inheritance by making the class final,
      if you make class final, implicitly it will make all the methods in
      it also final.

1) Single inheritance: inherits from one super class only.
   ex: Class B extends A{}

2) Multi level inheritance: inherits from class which itself derived from
                            another class.
                            ex: Class C extends B{} - B is already extended from A

3) Multiple inheritance: when a class inherits from more than one class
                         directly.
                         ex: Class F extends D, E{} - This is not supported in java by using classes.

4) Hierarchical inheritance: different classes inherits same Super class.
                             ex: Class B extends A{}
                                 Class C extends A{}
                                 Class D extends A{}
5) Hybrid inheritance: combination of multiple inheritance.
Scenario:
Let's say we have class C which is extended from B and B is Extended From A.
Also we have class called D

Hybrid ex: Class E extends D,C{} - Not Supported in java through classes
here E is combination of multilevel and Single inheritance.
