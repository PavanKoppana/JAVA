Polymorphism: it means "Many forms". it allows the same action(like same method)
to behave differently based on the object that performs it.

Types:
1) Compile time polymorphism: it will be resolved in compile time.
   example: constructor/method overloading which happens in compile time
   this mechanism is also known as Static Binding/Early Binding.

2) Runtime polymorphism: it will be resolved in runtime.
   example: method overriding which happens in runtime. This mechanism is
   also known as Dynamic binding/ Late Binding.

Dynamic method Dispatch: when you have overridden methods in inherited class
DMD will resolve the confusion and call the desired method in runt-time.
