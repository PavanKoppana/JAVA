Comparable: it is an interface used to define the natural ordering of an object of class.
            it should be implemented in user defined Object Class. it will perform "compareTo" method
            to sort, you can override the logic in user defined Object Class.
            Use Case: : Let's say you have student class which needs to be sorted by their corresponding
                        Roll No.
            Example: Refer Code for more Insights.


Comparator: it is also an interface used to define custom or multiple sorting strategies. it should
            be implemented outside the Object Class. it will perform "compare" method to sort. when you
            have multiple fields to sort like marks, age, Name. you can create custom comparators for
            multiple sorting strategies and override the compare method logic accordingly.

            Example: Refer the code.
