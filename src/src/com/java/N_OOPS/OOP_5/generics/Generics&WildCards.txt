Generics: it is a feature in java which allows us to perform type
          checking and type safety. Also, we can re-use the same class
          with different datatypes, and we can do that by specifying
          generic type in angle brackets "<>" .

          Example: ArrayList<Integer>


WildCards: In Java generics; wildcards are represented by "?" symbol.
           they allow methods or classes to operate on wide range of
           types without specifying the exact type.

Types of wild cards:

1) unbounded wild cards: allows to read all types of data irrespective of their generic datatype.
   you can only read the elements, writing is not allowed.
   Example: ArrayList<?>

2)lower bounded wild cards: allows to read corresponding datatypes of child
  classes of given class. only read operations.
  Example: ArrayList<? extends Number>

3)upper bounded wild cards: allows you to write/read corresponding datatypes of child
   classes of given class. Both write and read operations are allowed.
   Example: ArrayList<? Super Number>
