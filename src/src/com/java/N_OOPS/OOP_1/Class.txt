Class: class is a name group of properties and functions.
You can instantiate class by creating an object of it.
Object is basically an instance of class.

More Generic:
1) Class is a logical construct.
2) Object is a physical reality.

new Keyword: "new" key word is used to create objects in java.

Dynamic memory allocation: Dynamically allocates memory at Runtime and
                    returns to a refernce to the variable.
                    Ex: "Student studen1 = new Student();"
                    Student studen1-> happens in compile time.
                    new Student();-> happens in run time.
Hence, all class objects in java will be allocated dynamically.


Default Constructor: new object of a class is considered to be a by
          default constructor. Ex: "Student studen1 = new Student();"
          Student() -> by default constructor.

constructors won't be having return type, because the type of the
class itself is a return type.

Constructor overloading: you can overload a constructor n number of times,
               by updating the type of input arguments of it.

this keyword: In run time, "this" keyword will be replaced by the
              name of the reference variable or Current object.
