Nested Class: if you create a class inside a Top-Level class,
              it can be called as Nested class.

Inner Class: if you make a nested class as static then it can be called
             as inner class.

Fact: All inner classes are nested but not all the nested classes are inner.
      only static nested classes are considered to be an inner class.

1) Top level classes cannot be static.
2) Nested classes can be static. if nested class is non-static, you have to
   create the object of top level class of nested class and call the nested class.
