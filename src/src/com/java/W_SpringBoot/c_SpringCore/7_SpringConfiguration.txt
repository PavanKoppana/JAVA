Spring Configuration: it the information or blueprint that tells the Spring Core Container(IoC container, Application Context, Bean Factory)
                      about which beans to manage, how to wire them and their lifecycle details.

it can be achieved by:

1) XML Configuration -> old-school way, define beans in an XML file.
2) Annotations -> modern way, using @Component, @Autowired, etc.
3) Java-based Configuration -> using @Configuration and @Bean methods.
