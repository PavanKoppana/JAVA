Application Context: it is basically an interface of IoC container that manages bean life cycle
                     like instantiation. dependency injection, initialization and destruction.
                     it also features event handling and resource handling in spring boot.
     * it basically follows eager loading mechanism of beans, which means it will create beans at
       application startup itself. BeanFactory will do the opposite thing.
