Spring: it is an open-source Java framework providing a robust infrastructure for building
        enterprise-level applications. it core features include:

        -> Inversion of Control
        -> Dependency Injection
        -> Aspect-Oriented programming
        -> Supports various technologies like JPA, Hibernate, Spring MVC.



Spring Boot: it is an open-source, Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-ready
             Spring applications with minimal configuration. Built on top of the Spring Framework, it
             simplifies bootstrapping and development by offering default settings and reducing boiler plate.

             -> Embedded servers(Tomcat, Jetty)
             -> Auto-Configuration
             -> Starter Dependencies

Aspect Oriented programming: it allows us to write cross-cutting concerns once(as aspects) and apply
                             them automatically to multiple services. In a banking system. AOP cleanly
                             separates logging, security, and transactions from the business logic
                             like transfer() or withdraw().
