Spring Boot Actuator: it is a feature that adds production ready capabilities to the Spring Boot
                      application. making it easier to monitor, manage, and debug the production
                      environment. it provides some end points which will expose the data about the
                      original end point.

    -> For example you have one end point which will return you some response. in the ending if you
       replace the controller with actuator/health. it will return a JSON with health metrics of that
       endpoint. basically it will create some controllers internally which we can use to monitor, manage
       and debug the application while it was running.


Spring Boot Initializer: it will help us to initialize the Spring Boot Projects
                         with minimal user configuration.
