üîπ What is Bean Scope?

When Spring creates a bean, it needs to know:

Should the same instance be reused everywhere (singleton)?

Or should a new instance be created each time (prototype)?

Or should its lifecycle be tied to web requests/sessions?


üëâ Bean Scope tells Spring how to manage the lifecycle and visibility of a bean.

üîπ Common Bean Scopes in Spring

Spring defines several scopes. The main ones are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ singleton (Default)

Only one instance of the bean is created in the ApplicationContext.

Every injection of that bean will point to the same object.

Annotation: @Scope("singleton") (but usually not needed, since it's default).


@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class PaymentService {
}

Real-time Example:
A logging service or configuration service ‚Äî one instance is enough across the app.


---

2Ô∏è‚É£ prototype

A new bean instance is created each time it‚Äôs requested.

Annotation: @Scope("prototype").


@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class ReportGenerator {
}

Real-time Example:
A report generator or PDF exporter ‚Äî each request might need a fresh object with different parameters.


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ request (Web Only)

A new bean instance is created per HTTP request.

Valid only in web applications.

Annotation: @Scope("request").


@Component
@Scope("request")
public class RequestTracker {
}

Real-time Example:
A bean storing user request data like IP address, request ID ‚Äî unique per HTTP request.


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ session (Web Only)

A new bean instance is created per HTTP session.

Annotation: @Scope("session").


@Component
@Scope("session")
public class UserSessionData {
}

Real-time Example:
A bean holding shopping cart info ‚Äî tied to the user‚Äôs session, survives across multiple requests until logout.


---

5Ô∏è‚É£ application (Web Only)

A single bean instance is created per ServletContext (similar to singleton but in web scope).

Annotation: @Scope("application").


@Component
@Scope("application")
public class AppWideCache {
}

Real-time Example:
An application-wide cache shared across all sessions and requests.


---

6Ô∏è‚É£ websocket (WebSocket Only)

A bean instance is created per WebSocket session.

Annotation: @Scope("websocket").


@Component
@Scope("websocket")
public class WebSocketSessionHandler {
}

Real-time Example:
A chat session handler in a real-time chat application.

üîπ Summary Table of Bean Scopes

Scope Description Example Use Case

singleton One shared instance for the whole container Logging service, Config bean
prototype New instance every time requested Report generator, PDF exporter
request One instance per HTTP request Request audit log, Request ID
session One instance per HTTP session Shopping cart, User profile
application One instance per ServletContext (web) App-wide cache, Config state
websocket One instance per WebSocket session Chat session handler
