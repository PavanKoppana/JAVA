Maven Profile: it is a way to customize the build for different environments.
               * Profiles let you define different settings like dependencies, plugins, properties.
               * You can have multiple profiles in your pom.xml and activate one at build time.
               * In simple words if you want different dependencies for dev,qa and prod, you can
                 configure that in pom.xml using profile.|
