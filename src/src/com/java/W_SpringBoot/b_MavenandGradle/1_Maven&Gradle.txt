-> Maven and Gradle are dependency management and build automation tools
   used in SpringBoot.

   They handle:
   * Compiling code
   * Downloading Libraries
   * Packaging into JAR/WAR
   * Managing dependencies
   * Running Tests
   * Building and Deploying the app.


Maven: XML-based(pom.xml)
      * Dependency management via Maven Central repository.
      * Very Structured.

Gradle: Groovy/Kotlin-based(build.gradle)
        * faster when compared to Maven
        * Commonly used in android.
