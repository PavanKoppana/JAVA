Variables:

1) In order to access class level variables in static methods, you need to create object of
   the class before initiating the value. In Non-static methods you can access directly.
2) Instance variables is object specific, so everytime you create a new object, value will be
   reset to default.
3) Local variables is class specific, so it will refer to the last updated value which is sitting
   in the heap memory. because memory location of the literal will be stored in metaspace/method area
   which will stays alive as long as the class is loaded.
