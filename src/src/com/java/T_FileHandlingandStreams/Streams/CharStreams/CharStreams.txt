CharStream: work with char data for example JSON, XML, CSV.

Reader:
1) FileReader: read characters from files.
2) BufferedReader: adds buffering for efficiency (similar to byte streams).
3) InputStreamReader: Bridges between byte streams and char streams. Needed
                      when you want to read bytes but interpret them as text.
Common Methods of Reader:
 * read() -> to read data
 * close -> to release the resource.


Writer:
1) FileWriter: writes characters to files.
2) BufferedWriter: adds buffering for efficiency (similar to byte streams).
3) OutputStreamWriter: Bridges between byte streams and char streams. Needed
                       when you want to write bytes but interpret them as text.

Common Methods of Writer:
 * write() -> to write data
 * flush() -> to flush the Buffer. meaning - if your BufferedOutputStream created a buffer, and you want
              to write the file before buffer completes, you can use flush.
 * close -> to release the resource.
