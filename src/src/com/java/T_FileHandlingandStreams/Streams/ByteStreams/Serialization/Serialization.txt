Serialization: it is a process of converting a java object into byte stream to share across the
               network as a files. basically it will allow us to write byte data using ObjectOutputStream.

DeSerialization: it is process of converting byte stream into object. it allows us to read byte data
                 as an object using ObjectInputStream.

Serializable: it is a marker interface in java.io(it has no methods). if a class implements
              Serializable, it tells the JVM that object of this class can be serialized.
              if you don't implement it and try to serialize the object it will throw
              NotSerializableException. So, basically "Serializable" just gives permission
              for serialization.


transient keyword: used to exclude certain fields during Serialization. refer code for more details.
