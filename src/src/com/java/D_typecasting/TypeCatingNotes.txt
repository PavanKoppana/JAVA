1) Type Casting/Conversion is nothing but converting one data type into others.
2) There are two types of casting/conversion.
   2.1) Widening conversion: As the name suggests you can widen the small sized data type to large sized
   datatype. For example, you can widen a byte datatype to short and so on. This can be done without cast in syntax.

   2.2) Narrowing conversion: You narrow or cut down the larger data type into smaller one. But there will
        be potential cause of data loss if the value exceeds the range. For example, you can narrow an int
        datatype to byte. if the value is more than 300, there will be data loss.

3) Refer to the TypeCasting png file for the list of operations that you can perform as part type casting.

4) Automatic type promotion in expressions: if you are trying to perform an expression in java
   with multiple datatypes, it will convert the final value to the largest data type in the expression.
   So technically you have to declare a variable with the largest data type.
