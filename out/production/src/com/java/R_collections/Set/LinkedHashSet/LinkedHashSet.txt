LinkedHashSet: it is data structure which will store unique elements and
               preserves original order. it is backed by LinkedHashMap. internally
               every element will have the reference of next element and previous
               element. so internally it implements doubly linked list.

               * Duplicates are not allowed.
               * preserves insertion order.
               * one Null key/element is allowed.
