Arraylist: it is a class in java where we can implement resizable array.

    Properties:
    1) Unlike arrays, arraylist can grow dynamically in runtime. Let's say
       you declared an arraylist with initial capacity of 10, when you add
       11th element, internally an object will be created for arraylist with
       15 elements and copy the existing elements to newly created object
       (everytime you exceed the limit, it will grow by 50% of current size).
       the capacity is 15 but not the actual size.

    2) Along with growing dynamically, it can also shrink if remove the elements
       in the list.

    3) Memory allocation is non-contiguous if consider end to end.
       because the indices will be stored continuously but those indices
       doesn't have the actual objects it has references where the objects are
       scattered in heap memory.
