-> Static variables are not associated with the objects, they are associated with Classes.
   Always call static variables by there class name, not with object name.

-> Why main method is static?
Because main method is entry point for a java program to run. You can only create objects
after entering into the program, So you should expect at least one method to run before
creating object. which is nothing but a main method. since static fields/methods can
be created without objects, main method is declared as static.

-> Non-Static:
1) if something is non-static which means it belongs to an object.
2) You can't access a non-static members/stuff in static context without referencing or creating an instance of that class.
3) You can access static stuff in non-static members. You can also access static methods in another static methods.
4) You can also access non-static stuff in another non-static stuff in the same class,
    because anyhow you will create an object of it to call either of them.
5) You cannot use "this" keyword in static method


-> Static Block:
static block will run only once when the class is loaded for very first time.
it will be called without any method call.
