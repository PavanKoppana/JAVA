1) if condition: it will check whether the condition is true or not. if
   true it will execute the block of code written in "if block". if false it will
   skip that block of code.

2) if-else condition: if the "if" condition returns true, it will execute "if" block.
   if returns false it will execute else block.

3) if-else-if ladder: it will check multiple if condition in sequential order.

4) switch: Similar to if-else-if, but it won't check every condition instead it
   directly jumps into the fulfilling condition and implement that code.
   break statement is necessary to stop the flow or else it executes until it
   finds break.

 5) enhanced switch: refined version of switch statement, it doesn't need
    break statement.

 6) Nested if condition: "if" conditions within "if" conditions.

 7) Nested switch statements: "switch" statements within "switch" statements;
