 Loops: A loop in java is a control structure where you can execute a block a code
          repeatedly(or in a loop) until a condition is met.

2)Types of loops:
      1) for loop: it is recommended to use this if we already knew how many times we
                   need to run the loop. Refer the given code for syntax.

      2) while loop: it is recommended to use this loop when we are not sure on number of
         iterations that we need to execute. We need to declare the variable outside the loop.

      3) do while: similar to while loop but, no matter what it will iterate the loop
         at least once as the while condition will be written in the end.
         We need to declare the variable outside the loop.

      4) for-each loop: Advanced for loop can read all the elements in Data structures
                        without explicit declaration like for loop, refer code in Loops class
                        for detailed info.
