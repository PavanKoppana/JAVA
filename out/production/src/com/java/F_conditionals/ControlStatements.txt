1) break: it is a control structure/statement which will be used to terminate the
          loop when condition is true.

2) continue: it is a control structure/statement which will be used to skip a specific
             iteration in a loop based on the condition given.

3) return: it is a control structure/statement which will be used to terminate the
           whole method when condition is true.

4) labeled break/continue: when you have nested loops, you can assign an identifier
                           to loops and break/continue them by adding break or continue
                           followed by loop name. Refer the code more clarity.
