Array: An array is a collection of elements with same datatype.

    Properties of Array:
    1) All the elements in array should be of same data type.
    2) Once the size is assigned for an array, it is pretty much fixed,
       it won't grow dynamically.
    3) The declaration will happen in compile time.
    4) Initialization/Object creation will happen in runtime, this object
       creation is called Dynamic memory allocation.
    5) In other words dynamic memory allocation  is nothing but
       "The memory will be allocated in runtime."


    Memory Allocation of an Array:
    1) Array objects will be stored in heap memory.
    2) According to JLS(Java language specifications) heap objects are not
       stored in contiguous/continuos memory.
    3) In c/c++ it follows contiguous memory allocation.
    4) Continuos/Contiguous memory allocation means, where each process/object
       will be stored in a single/unbroken block of memory in the systems
       main memory(RAM).
    5) Since array objects in java are may or may not be contiguous. it all
       depends on how JVM handled that object in that time.
    6) But for primitive types it will store in contiguous format, because
       these are value variables.


    Insights: "new" keyword will be used to create an object.
               null is literal in java, null is only for non-primitives,
               it is a by default value of reference variables.
