Lambda Expressions: it is used to write short block of code which will take
                    input parameters and returns a value(Based on Functional interface
                    that we are using) they are mainly used to implement functional interfaces.
                    it is more or less can be considered as nested method. because
                    in java we don't have nested method so if you want to perform
                    a method inside a method, lambda expressions are good choice.

Lambda expression can be created by using Arrow operator "->"

Common Use Cases:

1) Simplifying anonymous classes.
2) Functional interfaces.
3) Collection and Stream API's.
4) Event Handling.
5) Concurrency and threading.
6) Method references.
