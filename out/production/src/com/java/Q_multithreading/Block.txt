Blocking and it's Challenges:

Blocking: the process of blocking another thread when one thread is
          executing in synchronized block. here thread 1 will acquire the lock
          of synchronized block. as long as it is actively executing in
          synchronized block it is the king of that block. once it is exited that
          block, or it went to wait state, it will release the lock.
          but sleep will not release the lock.

Use Cases:
to synchronize shared resources to it's corresponding threads.

Challenges:
-> Starvation: One thread doesn't get a chance due to other's hogging locks.
-> Priority Inversion: Low priority thread holds the lock needed by
   high priority threads.
-> LiveLock: threads keeps changing state to avoid deadlock but make no progress.
-> Deadlock: two or more threads wait on each other to release locks.
