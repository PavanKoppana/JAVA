Blocking and it's Challenges:

Blocking: the process of blocking another thread when one thread is
          executing in synchronized block.

Use Cases:
to synchronize shared resources to it's corresponding threads.

Challenges:
-> Starvation: One thread doesn't get a chance due to other's hogging locks.
-> Priority Inversion: Low priority thread holds the lock needed by
   high priority threads.
-> LiveLock: threads keeps changing state to avoid deadlock but make no progress.
-> Deadlock: two or more threads wait on each other to release locks.
