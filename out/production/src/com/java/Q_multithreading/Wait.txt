Wait Scenarios and Challenges:

Wait: it is state where we re explicitly making a thread to wait
      to get a signal from another thread to continue.

      Wait should be called in synchronized block and inside try block.
      notify() or notifyAll() should be called in synchronized block only.

Use Cases:
* Waiting for a buffer to be filled(producer-consumer).
* Waiting for a condition to be met (task completion).

Challenges:
-> Risk of waking up wrong thread or missing wakeup.
-> Risk of spurious wakeup(waking up some waiting thread randomly).
