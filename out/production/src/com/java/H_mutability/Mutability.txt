1) Immutable objects: Everytime you update the value of the immutable object
                   it will create a new object in heap memory instead of
                   re-writing the existing one. So the original object
                   remains same. Example: String.

2) Mutable objects: Everytime you update the value of the mutable object
                   it will update the same object in heap memory instead of
                   creating the new object. So the original object
                   will be updated. Example: Array.
