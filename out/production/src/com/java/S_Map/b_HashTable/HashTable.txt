HashTable: it is synchronized version of hashmap(every method is
           synchronized). it is thread safe as it is synchronized.
           but the problem is because of its method level synchronization
           it is slower than HashMap in single-threaded code. In modern java
           it is replaced by ConcurrentHashMap. check "ConcurrentHashMap.txt"
           for more details.
