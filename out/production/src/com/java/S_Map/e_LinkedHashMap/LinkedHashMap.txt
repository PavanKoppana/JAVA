LinkedHashMap: internally it will implement hashmap only, but it will
                preserve original insertion order. for every element/entry
                including key, value it also stores the reference of next
                bucket and previous bucket. in this sense it is implementing
                doubly linkedlist like structure and making sure all the
                elements/buckets are linked/chained together. hence the
                order is also predictable.

            * 1 Null key is allowed.
            * Multiple Null values are allowed.
