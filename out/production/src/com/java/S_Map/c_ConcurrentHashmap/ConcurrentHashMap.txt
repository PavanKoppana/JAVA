ConcurrentHashMap: it is a bit similar to HashTable, but HashTable perform synchronization in method
                   level. ConcurrentHashMap will perform synchronization at bucket level. it will
                   not lock entire table instead it will lock bucket which is getting operated or
                   accessed.

                   * null keys are not allowed.
                   * null values are not allowed.
                   * Thread safe.
                   * faster in multithreaded environment when compared to HashTable.
